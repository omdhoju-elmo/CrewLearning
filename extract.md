During peak operational times, there may be periods when leave requests cannot be approved. Employees will be notified of these block-out periods in advance.

#### Accessing Annual Leave

To access annual leave, employees must discuss their needs with their managers, submit requests through the designated system, and obtain approval before the leave is taken.

#### Excessive Annual Leave

If an employee's leave balance exceeds eight weeks, ELMO may direct them to take some leave to maintain a healthy balance and encourage the use of entitlements.

### Personal Leave

Employees are entitled to 10 days of personal leave each year for sickness or to care for an immediate family member. This leave is accrued based on hours worked and can be used for medical appointments or family emergencies.

In the event of a death or severe illness in the family, employees are entitled to three days of paid compassionate leave, along with additional leave under certain conditions.
